# Java Program for Thread Creating and use of its various methods.

A thread can be created and its many methods can be used in this Java program. The program creates a ThreadDemo class which extends the Thread class, and overrides its run() method. The run() method's code is executed when the thread is started.

The use of several Thread methods like start(), sleep(), isAlive(), getName(), currentThread(), and interrupt() is also demonstrated via the ThreadDemo class.

We are creating a thread by implementing the Runnable interface .

The fundamentals of establishing threads in Java and utilising their numerous methods are shown in this program. Developers can write scalable, effective programs that make use of the multi-threading capabilities of computer systems by learning how to create and use threads.
