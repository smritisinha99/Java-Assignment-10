# Java Program for Thread Creating and use of its various methods.

A thread can be created and its many methods can be used in this Java program. The program creates a ThreadDemo class which extends the Thread class, and overrides its run() method. The run() method's code is executed when the thread is started.

The use of several Thread methods like start(), sleep(), isAlive(), getName(), currentThread(), and interrupt() is also demonstrated via the ThreadDemo class.

We are creating a thread by implementing the Runnable interface .

The run() method of the Thread class is overridden by the ThreadDemo class, which extends it. A new thread is created to run the code contained in the run() function when the start() method is performed on a ThreadDemo object.

The sleep() function, which is another feature of the ThreadDemo class, puts the running thread to sleep for a predetermined number of milliseconds.

The fundamentals of establishing threads in Java and utilising their numerous methods are shown in this program. Developers can write scalable, effective programs that make use of the multi-threading capabilities of computer systems by learning how to create and use threads.
